	this is my answer

1. grep -i "^z" cities.txt
2. grep -i ".*gan$" cities.txt
-- I had to go into vi and change my line endings to unix for this to work
3. grep -i "^[ADE]" cities.txt
	grep -i -c "^[ADE]" cities.txt
4. grep -i "^.ar" cities.txt
	grep -i -c "^.ar" cities.txt
5. grep -i -v -c "^c" cities.txt
	grep -i -v "^c" cities.txt
6. egrep -i "[^' ']{14}" cities.txt
7. nngrep -i -c "^b" cities.txt
8. expr $(egrep -i -c "d" cities.txt) + $(egrep -i -c "d" cities.txt) - $(egrep -i -o "d" cities.txt | wc -l)
-- I haven't figured out had how to copy paste on linux so I manually typed this.
-- the math is querry1 - (querry2 - querry1)
-- then the numbers get rearanged to make the typing easier
-- querry1 + querry1 - querry2
-- querry1 is the amount of words that have a `d` in them.
-- querry2 is the amount of times the letter d shows up.
-- in theory, it should be querry2 - querry1 but that didn't give me the right answer because I did something wrong
-- I messed around and rearanged the numbers and got a convuluted answer that gives the answer required by the directions
9. egrep -i "(.)\1$" cities.txt
10. egrep -i "^(.)(.).\2\1$" cities.txt
